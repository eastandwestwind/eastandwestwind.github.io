How to make canned tomato sauce taste 10x better



Put some oil in a pan over a stove. Butter? Olive oil? Lard? You choose.

Get it warmed up while mincing your garlic.

Add all the spices + garlic to the pan. I like ground cayenne red pepper, black pepper, basil, oregano, parsley, blah blah blah. 

Simmer that for a couple minutes.

Pop in some red wine, stirring as you pour. 2-3 glasses should do.

Simmer.

Add tomato sauce. 

Stir and simmer.

Mmmmmm now you have a rich and tasty sauce.
