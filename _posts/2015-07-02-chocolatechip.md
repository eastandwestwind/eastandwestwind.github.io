title: The Chocolate Chip Cookies of your dreams
---

A recipe passed down to me from my harpsicord teacher in college, Mrs. Handford.

IMPORTANT: This recipe takes 2 days, mostly just waiting, but oh it is worth it. Be sure to set the butter out to soften a couple hours before starting.

2 cups minus 2 tablespoons (8 1/2 ounces) cake flour
1 2/3 cups (8 1/2 ounces) bread flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt like kosher 
2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter
1 1/4 cups (10 ounces) light brown sugar
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (8 ounces) granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract
1 1/4 pounds bittersweet chocolate chips, disks or f√®ves, at least 60 percent cacao content. 
Sea salt.

1. Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Set aside.
2. Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients a little at a time and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them. Sometimes i add chopped walnuts or pecans.  Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.
3. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
4. Scoop dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day. 
Notes:   Best results dough MUST be refrigerated 24 hours!  My grandma refrigerated 36 but I can never wait that long....
Generous golf balls make a large cookie.  You can reduce the size and bake a shorter time.  Just watch the oven, when they turn golden, they are done.  
A sprinkle of sea salt is also a must.   Not the large rock salt but the smaller, gentler kind.  I am a gourmet cook and use either the French Fleur de sel (flowers of salt) or Malden Sea Salt.
