Nicki and Riri are my rats.

It's thundering and raining outside. Nicki has her body hidden under a dark crevice under a desk on the far side of the room, with her head poking out.

Riri is running around like nothing is happening. I gave her chocolate, but she only nibbled a little bit. Nicki refused to eat.

I tried everything to coerce Nicki out from behind the desk but to no avail. 

I'm eating chocolate. Riri is diving into the box of goodies, ripping apart the cardboard with her little teeth. 

Oh wow, Nicki has emerged, made it around the desk, but then my mom burst in the room and Nicks retreated.

Ri is now                              d5         

on my keyboard and nibbling on my shirt and lips, but Ri! I gave you chocolate you little rascal. 

She leaps and prances across my down comforter like the happiest little rat, while Nicks nervously paces on top of her cage.
