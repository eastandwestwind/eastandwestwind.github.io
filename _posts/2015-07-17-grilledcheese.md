How to make a fantastic grilled cheese sandwich.



Put some butter in a pan over a stove.

When it has melted, lightly toast both sides of 2 slices of bread in the butter.

Put your choice of cheeses and honey dijon mustard between the slices of bread. I like havarti + cheddar.

Toasty toast on low-medium heat with pan covered.

Grilled cheese is the best.
