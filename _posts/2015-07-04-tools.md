title: 6 tools to make your life easier
---

A couple tools I use to make my life easier:

1. Mailbox: All email accounts in one. 
This tool helps me clean up my inbox to keep clutter at a minimum. Easy swipe functionalities to trash, archive, add to a list, or save for later.

2. Sunrise: A calendar app that syncs with google calendars. 
It is much easier to work with than the google calendar app.

3. f.lux: Adusts screen tint to match environment. 
In the daytime, it matches the sun, and at night, it matches the room you are in, which is a preset. This aids in sleep, especially when working later at night on the computer. Customizable gradients and sleep patterns are available.

4. Cinch: Resizes window based on which screen edge you hover over. 
This comes standard with windows computers now, but not with macs. Readjusting a window to half screen, full screen, and different desktops is possible with Cinch.

5. Delicious: Save links and tag them with keywords. 
This is much more than a bookmark tool, because of the tagging capability. This makes links a lot easier to find later.

6. Dropbox: Keep files off computer!
Pretty self-explainatory, but dropbox is great. I like to set up my screenshot functionality to automatically save within a folder in dropbox.
