In this blog, I take a look at "The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs," a study with data that comes default with R.  

Dose levels of Vitamin C are 0.5, 1, and 2 mg.  

The two delivery methods are orange juice (OJ) and ascorbic acid (VC).

As we can see, the highest dose produces the most significant results, with OJ being more effective except or the highest dose of 2 mg, when both delivery methods are equally effective.
