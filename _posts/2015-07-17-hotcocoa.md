How to make hot cocoa taste 10x better



Put all the cocoa powder you want to use in a cup.

Add just enough heavy cream (or light cream or half & half) to moisten all the powder. You need less than you think.

Stir to get all the bumps out, adding more cream as necessary.

It should look like thick mud at this point. Yum.

Add a little more cream, stirring it in like an OCD person would if they saw lumps in the mixture.

Repeat until the consistency is not like slush.

Heat in microwave.

Slowly add milk to fill the rest while stirring.

Heat in microwave.

Now that's good cocoa.
