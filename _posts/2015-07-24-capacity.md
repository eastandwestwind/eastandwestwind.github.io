title: Community capacity building in developing countries
---

Community capacity building: the "process of developing and strengthening the skills, instincts, abilities, processes and resources that organizations and communities need to survive, adapt, and thrive in the fast-changing world" (thanks wikipedia).

  
Capacity building differs from simply giving aid. Capacity building is a long-term effort in which the resources given to a community are sustainable and contributes to a longer term endeavor. Giving aid usually steers toward an immediate need, therefore a shorter-term approach. While giving aid to countries that need it certainly have their place, it should be done alongside efforts to build capacity in these countries or communities, for example helping to build a school and hire teachers alongside donating books.

  
To illustrate my point, donating shoes to a poor community may benefit those without shoes. But what about the local businesses that sell shoes and rely on the income for a living? While intentions may mean well, the inherent problem is not targeted in this case.

Now how would we help this community build capacity? Tal Dehtiar founded Oliberte to address just that. Oliberte shoes are manufactured in Ethiopia, which created jobs and helped those working gain skills they will have the rest of their lives. 

There are others.

  
In my opinion, solid education and healthcare are the two vital elements needed to bolster capacity in developing countries. 

The most challenging factors tend to be monetary limitations, societal stagnations, or government regulations. Other challenges are less clear, and vary depending upon the unique situation of a country. How about displaced people; people without homes?

Entrepreneurship is necessary to overcome these challenges and push forward.
