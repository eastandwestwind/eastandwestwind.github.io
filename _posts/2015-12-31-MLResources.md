title: Machine Learning Resources
---

Because of my recent interest in machine learning and AI, I figured I might as well put together a couple resources I have found useful thus far, or that I plan to spend some time on.


**Introduction (listed in order of approximate difficulty):**

[A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/), a beautiful and easy-to-understand website.

[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/), a Coursera course from Stanford that gives a broad introduction to ML.

[In-depth introduction to machine learning in 15 hours of expert videos](http://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/), from the Statistical Learning online course from Stanford.

[Intro to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271), an Udacity online course for learning the fundamentals of AI.

[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html), an online book that details both the core concepts and concrete examples of neural networks, using the MNIST data and Python.

A step-by-step [explaination of backpropogation](http://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/).

[Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), a book from MIT.


 

**In practice:**

[Visualizing neural networks in R](https://beckmw.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/visualizing-neural-networks-in-r-update/), a granular blog on nn visualizations.

[Applied Data Mining and Statistical Learning](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/node/133), resources from a Penn State online course that includes some classification and tree-based models in R.

[Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning), a curated list of ML frameworks by language.

[Titanic: Getting started with R](http://trevorstephens.com/post/73770963794/titanic-getting-started-with-r-part-5-random), an R tutorial on [Kaggle's competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
