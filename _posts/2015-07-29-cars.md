title: Cars Scatterplot and Regression
---

Here I investigate the relationship between car speed and stop distance in feet. Data from 1920s.

Also, I'm finally getting into regression visualization!

	> data()
	> head(cars)
	  speed dist
	1     4    2
	2     4   10
	3     7    4
	4     7   22
	5     8   16
	6     9   10
	> tail(cars)
	   speed dist
	45    23   54
	46    24   70
	47    24   92
	48    24   93
	49    24  120
	50    25   85
	> attach(cars) #why attach? makes easier to access without explicitly recalling, I think
	> plot(speed,dist,main="brake performance",xlab="speed",ylab="dist",pch=19)

	> abline(lm(dist~speed),col="red") #regression line
	> lines(lowess(speed,dist),col="blue") #lowess
	#note: lowess smoothing is best when line of best is hard to determine
	#or lease squares fitting doesn't create a good line of best fit

Ok so I admit, I obviously have no idea what I'm doing in regards to regression, but then again, I don't really know what I'm doing in any other sense. Keep on learning and experimenting!

I promise I'll be better at statistics within a year.

I checked with the R documentation, and here is what they have, as a note to myself for later:

	> plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
	+     las = 1, xlim = c(0, 25))
	> d <- seq(0, 25, length.out = 200)
	> for(degree in 1:4) {
	+   fm <- lm(dist ~ poly(speed, degree), data = cars)
	+   assign(paste("cars", degree, sep = "."), fm)
	+   lines(d, predict(fm, data.frame(speed = d)), col = degree)
	+ }
	> anova(cars.1, cars.2, cars.3, cars.4)

	4     45 10298  1    336.55 1.4707 0.2316

It looks like they assigned a polynomial regression. After looking into this a bit, I realized I should really be looking at r-squared, d.f., and P values to really determine fit.

So looking into how to find r-squared, I tried this:

	> summary(lm(dist~speed))$r.squared #regression line
	[1] 0.6510794
	> summary(lowess(speed,dist))$r.squared #and naturally the lowess line
	Error in summary(lowess(speed, dist))$r.squared : 
  	$ operator is invalid for atomic vectors 

But why is this invalid?
