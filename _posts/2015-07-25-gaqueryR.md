title: Export data from Google Analytics using R
---

Exporting your data from Google Analytics is great when you want to customize your visualizations.

To do this, you need to install devtools and rga:

	install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	install_github("rga", "skardhamar")
	library(rga)

You can find more about this on [GitHub](https://github.com/skardhamar/rga).

Check out the [Google Analytics Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/query-explorer/) to explore possible queries you can write.

	6                    Chicago        1  
	7                 Framingham        1  
	8                Los Angeles        1  
	9                    Madison        1  
	10 Meridian charter Township        1  
	> write.csv(sessions_city, file = "sessions_city.csv",row.names=FALSE)  

There, now you should be able to open the .csv in excel and do what you need. Be aware that in your queries with multiple entries per parameter, filters are separated by semicolons, while metrics and dimentions are separated by commas.
