Here are links to my favorite music of all time, updated regularly. 

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/thugfucker/a-mellow-trip-thru-the-desert">Thugfucker- A Mellow Trip thru the Desert</a>. This is a compilation of tracks put together quite coherently.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDI6HTR9arA">Blackmill Feat. Veela - Let It Be</a>. This is a chill melodic dubstep piece.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7Eeeh1IqVE&index=7&list=FLwuJBr3NfueLvMF6WP6Vpxg">J.S. Bach: Prelude BWV 998</a>. This work is performed on a lute.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foWxoMsl2hI&list=FLwuJBr3NfueLvMF6WP6Vpxg&index=8">Dave Stovall- Dave is in a Meeting</a>. I found this by watching a marimba piece on youtube, then contacted Dave, who said the marimba piece was an arrangement of this, a work for electric guitar and full string orchestra. If you're interested, the marimba piece is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdtmXYa6lz8">here</a>.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD7VKUSl6NU&index=9&list=FLwuJBr3NfueLvMF6WP6Vpxg">Antonio de Cabezon - Diferencias sobre la Pavana Italiana - Amaya Fernandez Pozuelo</a>. This is a really awesome piece performed on harpsichord.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt43oK__LC0&index=102&list=FLwuJBr3NfueLvMF6WP6Vpxg">Victor Wooten- More Love</a>. Check out his seamless guitar skills. Really nostalgic song for me.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNJTRhtgIFA">Beautiful arabian chillout - Lost In The Desert (mixed by SpringLady)</a>. Not the best mix in terms of general artistry, but I do love the songs in this compilation.
