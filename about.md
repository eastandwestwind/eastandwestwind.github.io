**ABOUT**

As a classical musician, we learn to interpret notes on a page, to find meaning in patterns, and to anticipate the direction of these patterns. Data analysis, too, is a means towards an understanding of the larger context, whatever that may be. 

In my free time, I enjoy romping around outdoors, <a href="https://vsco.co/eastandwestwind/" target="_blank">photography</a>, cooking, and skiing.
